title: Father-Son Duo

Chris Flint (40) and son, Aydan Flint (15) started training together in the spring of this year. Together, they have competed in several sprint triathlons and a few shorter running races. I asked Chris to tell me how it has been training and racing with his son: 

Bringing my son into the Triathlon world has been a blessing. It has really bonded our relationship. There have definitely been ups and downs along way the because ultimately he is still a kid and may not want to always put in the work needed to race competitively. At the end of day though, he always gets it done. Brian has been the glue that keeps us going. If I ever feel like he needs to step in and give Aydan advice or point him in the right direction, Brian does so in the appropriate way. The thing is, I’m his dad and on some matters, he just listens to Brian more intently. Brian is a great coach to myself and Aydan. He knows how to get the most out of us and we are always a threat in our respective age group just about wherever we go. I hope we continue to grow together, myself, Aydan, and Brian. It sure is a fun ride we are on and I don’t want it to stop!
