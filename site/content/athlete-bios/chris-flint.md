My name is Chris Flint. I am 40 years old. I am actually racing this weekend in the Derby City Trifecta (Olympic distance) in Louisville, KY. My upcoming races are Dixie Triathlon (Olympic distance) in Huntington, TN on 9/15/2018, after that the RyanMan Triathlon (half iron distance) in Rankin County, MS on 10/7/2018. I have some upcoming runs as well, Murray half marathon on 10/20/2018 and Tunnel Hill 10 miler on 11/3/2018 in Vienna, IL. I do not have much planned yet for next year, but I do plan to race Ironman Louisville in October of 2019. 



I have competed in 3 triathlons so far this year. Memphis in May Triathlon (Olympic distance) on 5/19/2018, Ironman 70.3 Wisconsin on 6/10/2018, and Paris Landing Sprint Triathlon on 7/14/2018. I have run in two 5k's as well.



I have competed in 10 triathlons and several runs of different distances, up to marathon, so far while training with Brian. My son, who is soon to be 15 started training with Brian in February of this year and has competed in 2 sprint triathlons so far and he will also race this weekend in the sprint and again in the Dixie in the sprint.



I am a diehard fitness enthusiast. Triathlon has allowed me to focus on 3 sports at once which I love. I also spend time strength training and cross training.
