My name is Peter Marshall. I am 25 years old and I serve Active Duty in the U.S. Army. My first goal during my training is to complete a Sprint Triathlon in September of this year which will be at the Dixie Triathlon. I began my training just a few weeks before deploying. Brian has worked with me one on one to create a personalized training plan even given my limited equipment available while I have been deployed. My upcoming year includes the sprint triathlon, and other triathlons when I can find them, a half marathon and in the spring I will finish my first Half Ironman in Chattanooga. I have made tremendous progress in the time I have had with Brianâ€™s training and I am looking forward to the time ahead of me to see what is next.
