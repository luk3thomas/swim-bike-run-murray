Test



My name is Megan Thomas. I am 32 years old and mother of four children 8 years old and under. I stay home with my children and help coach my sonâ€™s elementary school cross country team. I joined Swim Bike Run Murray in May of 2018. I really enjoy the accountability and community that comes with training on a team and with a coach. I recently completed my first sprint triathlon and I am currently training for my first Olympic distance triathlon, the Dixie Tri in September. Before training with Brian, I swam competitively as a youth, but had never ridden a road bike and was a beginner distance runner. Brian has been a tremendous help to me in learning the basics of triathlon training and learning how to balance family and training.
