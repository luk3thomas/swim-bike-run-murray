My name is Chris Flint. I am 40 years old. I have competed in 10 triathlons and several runs of different distances, up to marathon, while training with Brian. My son, who is soon to be 15 started training with Brian in February of this year and has competed in 2 sprint triathlons so far and he will race in two more sprint triathlons this year. 

This year I have competed in Memphis in May Triathlon, Ironman 70.3 Wisconsin, Paris Landing Sprint Triathlon, and Derby City Trifecta. I have run in two 5k's as well. My upcoming races are the Dixie Triathlon (Olympic), RyanMan Triathlon (Half Ironman), Murray, KY Half Marathon and the Tunnel Hill 10 miler. Next year I plan to race Ironman Louisville in October of 2019. 

I am a diehard fitness enthusiast. Triathlon has allowed me to focus on 3 sports at once which I love. I also spend time strength training and cross training.
