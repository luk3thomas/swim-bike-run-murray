Hi, this is Coach Brian Williams. I have been a certified USAT, USA and USMS Masters coach for a few years now.  However it feels like I have been coaching my entire adult life. Raising five kids, coaching baseball, softball, soccer, and swimming. Then as a Coast Guardsman, I trained, taught, and worked with adults from various backgrounds for over thirty years. Now I work part time as a substitute teacher (K-12) in the local school systems.  I believe these experiences have honed my skills as a successful coach. 

I have had the opportunity to coach athletes ranging in age from 12 to 65 over the past three years. From the Elite Youth and Junior Nationals, Age Group Nationals, to athletes who just wanted to have fun and finish a tri. All have overcome individual challenges, yet as a team we have finished each race. 

 I am currently coaching athletes from newbie’s who are training to complete their first sprint to a few who have their eyes set on the finish line at IM Louisville. One thing you will hear from anyone I coach is that I am always available. I do not have a graded fee for coaching. Everyone is treated the same regardless of experience. I study everyone’s progress daily on Training Peaks, but I also want to know how each athlete is feeling. There are a lot of things numbers can’t tell.
